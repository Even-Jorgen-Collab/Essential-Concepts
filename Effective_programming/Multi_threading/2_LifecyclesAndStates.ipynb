    "2. <b>Runnable State:</b><br>&emsp;A thread that is ready to run is moved to a runnable state. In this state, a thread might actually be running or it might be ready to run at any instant of time. It is the responsibility of the thread scheduler to give the thread, time to run. A multi-threaded program allocates a fixed amount of time to each individual thread. Each and every thread runs for a short while and then pauses and relinquishes the CPU to another thread so that other threads can get a chance to run. When this happens, all such threads that are ready to run, waiting for the CPU and the currently running thread lie in a runnable state.<p>\n",
    "3. <b>Blocked/Waiting state:</b><br>&emsp;When a thread is temporarily inactive, then it’s in one of the following states: \n",
    "   * Blocked\n",
    "   * Waiting\n",
    "   <p>\n",
    "4. <b>Timed Waiting:</b><br>&emsp;A thread lies in a timed waiting state when it calls a method with a time-out parameter. A thread lies in this state until the timeout is completed or until a notification is received. For example, when a thread calls sleep or a conditional wait, it is moved to a timed waiting state.<p>\n",
    "5. <b>Terminated State:</b><br>&emsp;A thread terminates because of either of the following reasons: \n",
    "   * Because it exits normally. This happens when the code of the thread has been entirely executed by the program.\n",
    "   * Because there occurred some unusual erroneous event, like segmentation fault or an unhandled exception."

    "<h3><b>Explanation:</b></h3> &emsp;&emsp;When a new <code>thread</code> is created, the <code>thread</code> is in the <b>New</b> state. When the <code>start()</code> method is called on a <code>thread</code>, the <code>thread</code> scheduler moves it to <b>Runnable</b> state. Whenever the <code>join()</code> method is called on a <code>thread</code> instance, the current <code>thread</code> executing that statement will wait for this <code>thread</code> to move to the <b>Terminated</b> state.
